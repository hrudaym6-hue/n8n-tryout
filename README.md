# Angular v20.3.0 Frontend for Legacy COBOL Migration

## Project Structure
This repo contains the migration of a legacy COBOL application into Angular v20.3.0 frontend code based entirely on extracted user stories.

### Folder Locations
- **angular-app/**  : Main Angular project root
  - **src/app/**   : All generated UI components, routing and logic
  - **extracted/** : User stories JSON (source for generation)

## Features
- Modular Angular 20.3.0 application
- Routing for all major UI flows
- Reactive Forms and validation for login, transfer, and edit components
- Data-driven UI from user stories
- Example mock data for demo purposes
- Ready for service integration or real backend

## Getting Started
1. Install Angular CLI:
   
2. Install project dependencies:
   
3. Run the development server:
   
4. Open [http://localhost:4200](http://localhost:4200)

## UI Flows
- Login (with validation and lockout logic)
- Account Details (view and edit)
- Transaction List and Transfer (validation and error handling)

## Code Generation
This code was generated automatically from user-stories.json extracted from legacy COBOL applications, ensuring complete feature parity and migrated business logic.
